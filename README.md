# Realtime-Deepfake-Detection
This project is a real-time deepfake detection system implemented in PyTorch. Deepfakes are manipulated videos or images that use artificial intelligence to swap faces or modify visual content, often with malicious intent. The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting deepfake videos in real-time.
